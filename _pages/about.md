<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Pervasive Interaction Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on human–AI collaboration with generative models, behavioral modeling and intervention, health and well-being. Previously, I received my B.S. in Automation from Tsinghua University.

I'm very honored to be advised by [Prof. Yuanchun Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TZm3-pwAAAAJ) and [A/Prof. Yuntao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kHpwoAUAAAAJ). Their guidance inspires me to connect computational methods with real-world human-centered challenges.

Now in my second year in PI Lab, I'm continuing to explore human–computer interaction(HCI). Always happy to connect, exchange ideas and collaborate on projects! Also looking for **internship**, **collaboration**, and **visiting opportunities** to broaden my horizons and grow as a researcher!
